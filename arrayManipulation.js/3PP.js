Sure thing! Here's a slightly more challenging problem:

**Problem: Partition Array into Three Parts**
  
Given an array of integers, rearrange the array *in-place* such that:
1. All negative numbers appear first.
2. All zeros appear in the middle.
3. All positive numbers appear at the end.

The relative order of the numbers within their categories does not need to be maintained.  

**Example Input:**  
`[0, -1, 2, -3, 0, 4, -5]`  

**Example Output:**  
`[-1, -3, -5, 0, 0, 2, 4]`  

---
- Solve the problem in one pass (or as close to it as possible) using in-place swaps.
- No extra arrays or data structures should be used.
  
Let me know your solution or if youâ€™d like hints along the way!
