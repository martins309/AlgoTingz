/*
create an empty array  that you'll return at the end
and take a look at the smallest values in each input array
do while loops use counters call i and j
they need to start at zero
while there are still values that we haven't looked at not at the end of the array


we are going to compare the item in the first array to the item in the second array
if the item in the first array is smaller than the item in the second array
push the value of the first array into the results and move on the the next
value in the first array

If the value of the first array is larger than the value of second array
push the value of the seconds array into the results and move on to the next
item in the second array

one we exhaust on array, push in all remaining values from the other array
