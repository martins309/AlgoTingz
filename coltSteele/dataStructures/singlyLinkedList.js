// here is the first time im using advanced data structure.
// my intro to singly linked lists :)



// what is a linked list?

// a data structures that contain a head a tail and a length
// a linked list has no indicies that just point to the next element
//linked lists consists of nodes and 
// each node has a value and a pointer that points to the next node 
// or null


class Node{
    constructor(val){
        this.val = val
        this.next = 0

    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList{
    constructor(){
        this.head = null
        this.tail = null
        this.length = 0
    }
    push(val){

    }
}
