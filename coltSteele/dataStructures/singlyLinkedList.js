// here is the first time im using advanced data structure.
// my intro to singly linked lists :)



// what is a linked list?

// a data structures that contain a head a tail and a length
// a linked list has no indicies that just point to the next element
//linked lists consists of nodes and 
// each node has a value and a pointer that points to the next node 
// or null

//the function should accept a val
//create a new node using the value passed to the function
//if there is no head on the list set the head and the tail to be the newly created node
//otherwise set the next property on the tail to be the new node
// and set the tail property on the list to be the newly created node
//increment the length by one
